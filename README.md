# MOMD
MOMD is to calculate one-nucleon knockout cross sections in fixed-target
nuclear reactions at middle energies (30MeV/u - 2GMeV/u). This code is
supposed to serve as a calculating tool for theoretical expectations of
experiments conducted at the External Target Facility in HIRFL-CSR, IMP.

This code is transcripted from fortran code MOMDIS by C.A. Bertulani and A. Gade
in Ref. Comp. Phys. Comm. 175 (2006) 372-380.
