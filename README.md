# MOMD
MOMD is to calculate one-nucleon knockout cross sections in fixed-target
nuclear reactions at middle energies (30MeV/u - 2GMeV/u). This code is
supposed to serve as a calculating tool for theoretical expectations of
experiments conducted at the External Target Facility in HIRFL-CSR, IMP.

# SUNNY
sunny is a project for shell modle full configuration interaction calculations
for many-body problems involved in microscopic structure of atomic nuclei.
