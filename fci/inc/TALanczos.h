  \class TALanczos
  \brief Lanczos algorithm for solving large sparse matrix iteratively. Transcribbed
  from momd/TADiagonalize::Lanczos and momd/TADiagonalize::LanczosPurge, but with
  new classes representing large sparse matrix using ROOT - TTree object storing
  large sparse matrix and vectors, so as to save memory. This is a static class.
  Dedicated for diagonalization problems arising from large-scale shell model calculations.
